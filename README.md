# 📊 NYC Airbnb Spreadsheet Analysis

This project uses spreadsheet tools to analyze Airbnb listings in New York City and identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property types for short-term rental investment. Completed as part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Bootcamp, the analysis demonstrates how spreadsheet software like **Google Sheets** (or **Excel**) can be used to generate actionable business insights.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

You’ve been tasked with helping a client determine where to focus their Airbnb investments in Manhattan. Your objective was to explore trends in pricing, demand, and location performance to inform their real estate decisions.

The project answers key business questions using pivot tables, formulas, and basic visualization techniques.

## 📟 The Dataset

- Public Airbnb dataset for New York City, including:
  - `neighborhood`
  - `room_type`
  - `price`
  - `minimum_nights`
  - `number_of_reviews`
  - `scrape_id`, and other metadata

> **Note:** In the Excel version, the `scrape_id` column may appear as `###`. This is a display issue caused by narrow column width and **does not affect the actual data**. You can widen the column or view the file in Google Sheets to display values correctly.
